PROJECT TITLE: 07.10_Assignment / Movie.java; MovieTesterV3.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create an array of movie objects with names, years, and 
                        studios and to sort them by these categories using
                        selection sort

******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: It was rather easy to change the insertion sort to selection sort
      
<-s>: I should have taken advantage of copy-paste while changing the sort categories
        then just modified them to sort their individual categories
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will use copy paste when I need to rather than reinventing the
                wheel any time I need a similar function to one I've already written
