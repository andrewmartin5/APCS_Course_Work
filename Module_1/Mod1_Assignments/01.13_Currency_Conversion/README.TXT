******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: Figuring out the calculations and print statements were easy to implement
      Writing documentation was simple, as I did it as I was going
      
<-s>: Organizing my code was rather difficult, as I had just put things wherever
          they landed. This was easy to fix, but took some time.
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will write my code according to a template instead of writing
                   wherever.
