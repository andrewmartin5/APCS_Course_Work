******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: Working with variables was easy, and there were very few issues.
      Printing the output also went very well and was easy to format after a few 
           tries.
      
<-s>: It took a very long time to edit the names of the variables, and I made a few
           mistakes (these were easily found thanks to compling errors).
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will think further ahead to decide final variable names before I 
     implement them
