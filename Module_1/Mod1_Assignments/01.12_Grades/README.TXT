PROJECT TITLE: 01.12_Grades / GradesV2.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To print out a table that displays the test number,
    test grade, total points, and the average test grade. The goal is to use
    shortcuts such as ++ or += to make the math more efficient.

******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: Using the print statements were easy
      Working with the shortcuts made the math side of the program easier.
      
<-s>: I had trouble calculating my averages as a double. This was easily fixed once
           I realized that I needed to change one of the inputs to a double first.
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will pay more attention to the data types I used to prevent math
errors like I ran into with this project.
