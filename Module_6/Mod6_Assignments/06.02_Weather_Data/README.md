<+s>: Getting the ability to switch between units was rather easy to implement
      
<-s>: Using the printf() function proved to be rather difficult, especially because
        had not read the documentation.
************************************************************************************
In the future: When working with a new function or class, I will be sure to read the
                Documentation beforehand.
