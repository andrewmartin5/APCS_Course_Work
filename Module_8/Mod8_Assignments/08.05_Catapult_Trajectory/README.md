PROJECT TITLE: 08.05_Catapult_Trajectory / Catapult.java; CatapultTester.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a catapult object, as well as a way to calculate and
                        display distance when given angle and initial velocity

******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: Implementing the catapult was rather easy, as well as printing the 2d array
      
<-s>: I realized I should probably have my program be able to accept a varying 
        amount of velocities and angles, which took time to implement afterwards
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will think ahead when I'm planning out my program and implement
                any funcionality when I'm developing it rather than after I am 
                finished.
