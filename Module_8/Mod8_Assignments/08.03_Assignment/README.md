******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: I figured out the title search rather easily
      
<-s>: Using binary sort to find multiple things (author, year) was rather difficult
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will think ahead to make my single-search algorithms easily
                reworkable into a multi-search algorithm
