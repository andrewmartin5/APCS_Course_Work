PROJECT TITLE: 04.07_Password_Generator / Password_Generator.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To generate random passwords of a length specified by the user
                        that uses different combinations of characters specified by
                        a user menu input. Passwords are stored to a file and then
                        read to the user.

******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: Reading and writing to the file came easily.
      
<-s>: I planned my code very badly, resulting in some odd organization that had to
        be patched together later in the coding process. This resulted in some very
        heavily nested conditionals and loops. I also had to use a break
        statement because the organization in one of my while loops was poorly
        planned.
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will include organization in my pseudocode to make it easier for
                myself later in the coding process.
