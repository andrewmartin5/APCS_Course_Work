PROJECT TITLE: 04.06_Monte_Carlo_Method / AnimalPopulation.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use the Monte Carlo method to simulate the chances of finding
                        an albino rabbit by saving and reading information from
                        files.

******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: I managed to write the information to the file easily, and it worked on the
        first try.
      
<-s>: I had trouble reading from the file. It turns out that I hadn't closed the
        PrintWriter, which meant that the Scanner couldn't access the file
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will ensure that a file is only accessed by one object at a time.
