******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: Using the Scanner class was easy to figure out, and implimenting the counters
        for each gender combination was easy.
      
<-s>: I struggled to figure out how to round the output, but I eventually figured a
        way to do it, though it may not be the most efficient.

In the future: I will improve my variable names to improve readability
