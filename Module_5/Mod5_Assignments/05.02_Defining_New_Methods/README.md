PROJECT TITLE: 05.02_Defining_New_Methods / PlanetGravity.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To calculate the gravity of multiple planets by using multiple
                        static methods. Takes diameter and mass and uses it to
                        calculate gravity.

******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: Defining and using methods were easy, and made the project faster to code
      
<-s>: I messed up my calculation formula, and it took me over an hour and a half
        to notice that I had made my calculations as if there were 1000 kilometers
        in a meter, instead of the other way around.

In the future: When debugging, I will step through the individual parts of my 
                        formula
