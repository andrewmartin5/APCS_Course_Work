PROJECT TITLE: 09.08_Thinking_Outside_the_Box ; PrimeTester.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a program that can be used to calculate all prime 
                        numbers between two numbers.

<+s>: I loved implementing the progress bar. It was just a personal touch because I
        was curious if I could do it, and it turns out I could.
      
<-s>: When I started looking at the program, I tried to find prime numbers only by
        removing numbers divisible by 2 , 3, and 5. This was a good start, but it 
        wouldn't get all of my primes.

In the future: I will ensure that my calculation method works for at least one test 
                before I implement it.
