******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: I got the insertion and selection algorhithms working rather quickly, and 
        even managed to do so in less lines than my last implementation.
      
<-s>: It was difficult to get the merge function working. I understood the 
        mergeSort() function, but the merge() function took a lot of work to give 
        good results.
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will make sure I understand how an algorhithm works in its entirety
                before trying to implement it.
