******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: I figured out the recursion method rather easily
      
<-s>: It was inconvenient to test each individual value; I should have created a 
        loop that continued until the program was unable to keep up.
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will use loops to test values when it is convenient to.
