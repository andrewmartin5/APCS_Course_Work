PROJECT TITLE: 02.09_Making_Metthod_Calls / MakingMethodCalls.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To calculate 10 + 5, 10 * 5, andd 10 / 5 while taking advantage
                        of already created methods.

<+s>: Using the prewritten methods to print an output was very easy
      
<-s>: The first time I wrote the devision part of the main() method, I accidentally
        set the answer to be a double, resulting in it printing the answer 2.0. This
        was easy to fix by just switching out the data type to the correct one.
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will use methods to make my code more legible and organised. This
                    will also help me because I won't have to copy my own code every
                    time I need to do something
