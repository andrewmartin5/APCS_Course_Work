PROJECT TITLE: 02.03_Math_Class_Methods / PyTheorem.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To calculate the hypotenuse of two triangles after creating random
                        values for the triangles' sides in the range (5, 23]

******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: Writing the calculations for hypotenuse were very easy using Math.hypot()
      Printing my answers was very straightforward
      
<-s>: Making a random number generator with a range while using Math.random() was
        complicated and took lots of time. The first draft was also very messy and
        it took some time to clean up that line.
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will try to make my code as readable as possible on the first draft
