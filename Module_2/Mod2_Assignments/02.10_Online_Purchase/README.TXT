******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: Figuring out my input was simple, as well as using if statements to filter
        user input.
      
<-s>: When I was coding this project, I wrote documentation as I went, but forgot to
        leave white space, which made it very hard to understand and read the code
        until I fixed it.
************************************************************************************
In the future: I will write my code while leaving white space where it makes sense
                    to improve readability and ease of navigation/editing.
